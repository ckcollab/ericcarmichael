Summary: I have been binge watching Pycon 2014 videos and I thought I might as well make that productive somehow, so here's a list of the best videos (in my *very humble* opinion)!

## Python Macgyvering

[David Beazley](https://twitter.com/dabeaz) slays it. As an expert witness he writes his own versions of simple things and comes up with
interesting ways to reverse engineering/research a huge codebase.

## Imposter Syndrome

[Julie Pagano](https://twitter.com/juliepagano) reminds us to maybe not be so hard on ourselves. This one is especially
important to me, because I am starting a new job soon and there's a large part of me that feels like I may not fit in.

That is **bull shit!**

I don't know why we get these strange fears. Everyone has that awkward first day but I'm sure at my new job the people
are looking out for my best interests. They want me to be happy and feel welcomed, so I just need to think positive
and do my best&mdash;no reason to worry!

## Helicopter Badassery


[Ned Jackson Lovely](https://github.com/njl) flies an awesome [little helicopter](http://www.amazon.com/Syma-S107G-Channel-Helicopter-Gyro/dp/B00F4WMAI4/ref=lp_166591011_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1400608454&sr=1-1)
around with python! Imagine flying this into your family and friends via iPython, what joy!

This also goes into quite a bit of arduino stuff which is something I am trying to get into, pretty interesting.

## Memcached ins-and-outs

[Guillaume Ardaud](https://twitter.com/gardaud) goes into some great specific about memcached, a lot of stuff I didn't know--like you pronounce
memcached "memcache dee"!

I think this guy is a pretty good speaker to model yourself after. He was confident and obviously practiced a lot beforehand,
really enjoyed this presentation.

## Machine learning for personalized Hacker News

[Ned Jackson Lovely](https://twitter.com/nedjl) did an awesome presentation on machine learning/sciki. It was very beginner
friendly. My favorite part was probably the flow chart "if you have less than 50 samples, get more samples."

## Computer Science education in the US

[Jessica McKellar](https://twitter.com/jessicamckellar) talks about how we could get more kids involved with computer science.
What I thought stood out about her presentation was concrete ideas/details, like:

 * Make Computer Science count as a Math/Sci credit instead of being an elective -- encourages teachers and students to take it more seriously
 * Switch from Java to Python&mdash;don't throw people into the deep end of OOP, etc.
 * Call your local school board/legislature and talk about the above simple steps.
