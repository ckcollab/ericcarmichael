Something is happened I'm not sure anyone could have predicted: we can run Linux on Windows 10... natively!

Somehow the latest Windows 10 kernel has direct mappings for Linux to talk to, so it's not even (based on my understanding) 
quite like WINE or Cygwin.





Linuxbrew




Huge pains installing things through brew, have to build everything from source takes ~25min

Finding I have to install glibc and gcc via brew first???
