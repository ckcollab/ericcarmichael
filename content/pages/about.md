### Who am I?

I'm Eric Carmichael, I live in beautiful Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and I love solving difficult problems.

Seeing a feature come to fruition gives me a huge sense of satisfaction.

### What am I about?

In college my plan was to become a highschool computer science teacher and give kids my age an opportunity to learn coding,
most highschool classes only teach Visual Basic&mdash;I wanted to teach Python and JavaScript! Sadly, my plans to become a teacher
were cut short when my mother was in a horrible motorcycle accident.  She was left with massive brain damage, barely making out of
a coma with 1% chance to survive.

I dropped out of college, moved home and took care of her. To make some money while being my mother's caretaker
I decided to start my own development business in 2012. Researched for hours and hours trying to find the best framework for
my personality best. When I finally stepped on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Python](http://python.org)
I was shocked by how awesome and passionate the community was. I had to try it and I've been loving it ever since!

Outside of programming I love powerlifting and fishing. I just recently bought a little sit on top kayak and I take it out
every chance I get! Also, I hold two powerlifting state records @ 148lbs with a 405lb deadlift and 275lb bench press.
