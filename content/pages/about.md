# About me

I was fortunate enough to grow up in a home where I was encouraged to play around on the computer and experiment with
things. At a very young age I developed a passion for solving problems quickly and the motivation to keep going when
I am stuck. I would struggle for days at a time trying to get one piece of an elaborate puzzle solved. Whether it was an
OCR to automate picking up items in a hack and slash game or making a PHP autoinstaller work in 1 click. I took pride in
being able to solve problems.

I was hooked. Solving difficult problems gives me a huge sense of satisfaction.

Another interesting problem I solved by [creating a clientless Diablo II maphack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL7K58Cdo5Y)
which is as undetectable a maphack as you can get! I also got a kick out of helping one of my highschool teachers by making a
PHP CMS for lecture notes and online tests. I felt fulfilled.

In college my plan was to become a highschool computer science teacher and give kids my age an opportunity to learn coding,
most highschool classes only teach Visual Basic&mdash;I wanted to teach Python and JavaScript! Sadly, my plans to become a teacher
were cut short when my mother was in a horrible motorcycle accident.  She was left with massive brain damage, barely making out of
a coma with 1% chance to survive.

I dropped out of college, moved home and took care of her. To make some money while being my mother's caretaker
I decided to start my own development shop so I did some research and started learning the framework that fit my
personality best: Django!

Outside of programming I love powerlifting and fishing. I just recently bought a little sit on top kayak and I take it out
every chance I get! Also, I hold two powerlifting state records @ 148lbs with a 405lb deadlift and 275lb bench press.
