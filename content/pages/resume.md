# About me

I was fortunate enough to grow up in a home where I was encouraged to play around on the computer and experiment with
things. At a very young age I developed a passion for solving problems quickly and seeing results.

I was hooked. Solving difficult problems gives me a huge sense of satisfaction.

Whether that problem was [creating a clientless Diablo II maphack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL7K58Cdo5Y) or helping out one of my highschool teachers by making a
PHP CMS for lecture notes and online tests, I felt fulfilled.

In college my plan was to become a highschool computer science teacher and give kids my age an opportunity to learn coding,
most highschool classes only teach Visual Basic&mdash;I wanted to teach Python and JavaScript! Sadly, my plans to become a teacher
were cut short when my mother was in a horrible motorcycle accident.  She was left with massive brain damage, barely making out of
a coma with 1% chance to survive.

I dropped out of college, moved home and took care of her. To make some money while being my mother's caretaker
I decided to start my own development shop so I did some research and started learning the framework that fit my
personality best: Django!

Outside of programming I love powerlifting and fishing. I just recently bought a little sit on top kayak and I take it out
every chance I get! Also, I hold two powerlifting state records @ 148lbs with a 405lb deadlift and 275lb bench press.




# Skills

**Preferred area of development** &mdash; on the backend writing [django-rest-framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
API's and unit tests. I love making things fast by adding caching at key points and using [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) to queue up tasks
asynchronously.

**My second most comfortable seat** &mdash;  in the JavaScript frontend plugging things in and making them work, usually with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) or [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/).

I'm not a very talented (to put it nicely) designer, I don't have the best style. I work best when I can rely on someone who's great at
design to polish features, that way I can worry about making things work and not about how many pixels of margin
or what color is needed!


# Work

I constantly strive to make myself better, I track my strength gains with an app I made called Personal Record.

I make the best of every day by tracking my mood with another personal app I made called Chin Up.

I worked with a great team on [ScrapBin](http://scrapbin.com), the coolest thing I did there were to convince the team lead
to switch from Drupal to Django with a quick prototype that had features to search, display results on a map and have
map markers with extra info. The second coolest thing was to add a super efficient "saved search" via [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) percolators.
