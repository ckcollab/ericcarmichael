# Skills

### Primarily backend
I like writing [django-rest-framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
API's and unit tests. I love making things fast by adding caching at key points and using [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) to queue up tasks
asynchronously.

### Secondarily frontend

I enjoy plugging things in and making them work, usually with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) or [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/).

I'm not a very talented (to put it nicely) designer, I don't have the best style. I work best when I can rely on someone who's great at
design to polish features, that way I can worry about making things work and they can worry about how things look!


# Work

## PersonalRecord.net

I strive to make myself better, I track my strength gains with an app I made called [Personal Record](http://personalrecord.net).

I make the best of every day by tracking my mood with a personal app I made called [chin up](https://github.com/ckcollab/chin-up). The name comes from the phrase
"keep your chin up!"

With chin-up I track some daily metrics (Strength, Flexibility, Relationships) as well as monthly overall metrics (Nature,
Life goals, etc.). Each metric is rated 1-10 and has an optional notes field. I wanted it to be as simple as possible to
encourage consistent usage.

I worked with a great team on [ScrapBin](http://scrapbin.com) for a year. The coolest thing I did there was to convince the team lead
to switch from Drupal to Django with a quick prototype that had features to search, display results on a map and have
map markers with extra info. The second coolest thing was to add a super efficient "saved search" via [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
percolators that gave real time listing updates.
