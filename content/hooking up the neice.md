The rig

Specs
 * alskdfj
 * laskjdf
 * alskdjf
 * The amazing ability to create a lifelong passion for solving problems

Unfortunately all I have available is this computer and Windows 7, if the stars aligned just right I would have an old
Mac she could use. Mac would definitely be the ideal environment.


## Setting up the software

Installed the basics (ninite link)
Installed python
Installed PyCharm
Downloaded tons of videos, I learned best from videos and she's not allowed online.


## Engaging assignments

Wrote a few small assignments she can attempt and call me anytime for questions:

 * Hello world + variables
 * United States quizzer
 * Command line calculator
 * Harry Potter trivia


## Expanding

I also got her an [HTML book]() I think could help her out, and a couple example assignments:

 * Make a website dedicated Michael Jackson, I'll put it online for you!
   * About Michael
   * About my favorite MJ song
 * Make a website dedicated to your family
   * A funny story
   * A perfect family get together--what would that be? Everyone goes to somewhere in California and hangs out on the beach?
   * Thanks to your family for all of their help
 * Make a website about your volleyball team
   * The team members, who are they?
   * Best game of the season
   * Funniest story
